Insight Data Challenges
-----------------------


Each directory in this repo is a different data challenge done while I was a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com).

I tend to favor [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) these challenges because I find the output format inherently cleaner. Also the plaintext nature of the files makes version control behave nicely. I use [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) to use relevant or necessary Python packages.
