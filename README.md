Insight Data Challenges
-----------------------


Each directory in this repo is a different data challenge done while I was a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science.

I tend to favor RMarkdown these challenges because I find the output format inherently cleaner. Also the plaintext nature of the files makes version control play nicer. I use reticulate to use relevant or necessary Python packages.
